<section class="article__content ts" id="content">
<p>Bonjour, my name is Antoine Jaunard (1990), I'm a designer from Brussels, Belgium, and now based in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>I consider myself a creative technologist with a particular interest in the intersection between the physical and the digital. I have extensive experience in graphic design and web development, as well as a good knowledge of digital fabrication techniques and product design. In addition, microorganisms such as bacteria and mycelium fascinate and inspire me, inviting me to develop special tools for their cultivation.</p>

<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<h2 id="domingo-club-2021-">Domingo Club (2021-)</h2>
<p>In march 2021, together with Maud Bausier, we founded <a class="external" href="https://domingoclub.com/" target="_blank">Domingo Club</a>, an on/offline space where we design a plant-based and transparent future food system. Our current focus is on our open-source fermenter, a device that promotes plant-based proteins and open-source tools so that anyone can make them at home. We dedicate practice to the benefit of our health, our communities and our planet.</p>
<h3 id="we-have-a-strong-interest-in">We have a strong interest in</h3>
<ul>
<li>digital and decentralised fabrication</li>
<li>microorganisms, mycelial network and bio-materials</li>
<li>plant-based food and fermentation technology</li>
<li>education, open-source and knowledge sharing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="our-fields-of-expertise-are">Our fields of expertise are</h3>
<ul>
<li>prototype design and development</li>
<li>environmental sensing and physical computing</li>
<li>digital fabrication</li>
<li>teaching and community building</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fab-academy-2020">Fab Academy (2020)</h2>
<p>I'm an alumnus of the design and digital fabrication post-graduate program <a class="external" href="https://fabacademy.org/" target="_blank">Fab Academy</a>. I attended the program in <a class="external" href="https://fablabbcn.org/" target="_blank">Fab Lab Barcelona</a>.</p>
<p>Fab Academy is a Digital Fabrication programme directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything. Fab Academy focuses on personal fabrication – prototyping your ideas into products.</p>
<p>This intensive program is about designing and prototyping projects using digital fabrication tools and machine, such as: computer-controlled cutting, electronics, 3D scanning and printing, electronics design,computer-controlled machining, embedded programming, molding and casting, networking and communications, mechanical design, interface and application programming and machine design.</p>
<h2 id="variable-2014-2019">Variable (2014-2019)</h2>
<p>Together with Constant Mathieu, we had run a small but good webdesign studio called <a class="external" href="http://variable.club/" target="_blank">Variable</a>, from 2014 to 2019. We had put emphasis on creating our own custom tools to stay task-specific, light and versatile.</p>
<p>During our journey, we had the chance to work for/with a music festival (Schiev), a web radio (The Word Radio), a contemporary art museum (MIMA), a centre for contemporary art and an independent cinema (Netwerk Aalst), few architecture offices (Office KGDVS, V+, A Practice), an art school (La Cambre), and many more.</p>
<h2 id="ecole-de-recherche-graphique-2010-2014">École de Recherche Graphique (2010-2014)</h2>
<p>I'm graduated in Art and Graphic Design at the <a class="external" href="http://erg.be" target="_blank">École de Recherche Graphique</a> (ERG) of Brussels.
It was all about learning how to learn, hacking systems, building things without any budget, finding the right tone to communicate with others.</p>
<h1 id="about-this-website">About this website</h1>
<p>This website is my digital studio, a place where I can experiment without constraints.</p>
<p>It's also my personal assistant, it helps me when I doubt on how to do something I have done before. It invites me to write (and then find) my personal knowledge online.
A tool for documenting the things I learn.</p>
<p>This website is built with a custom static site generator that I wrote in Python. It's open-source by default, as all the things I (try to) do. Sources are available on <a class="external" href="https://github.com/antoine3000/personal-website" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
