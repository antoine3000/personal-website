## Concept

- [Elowan (MIT Media Lab)](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/elowan-a-plant-robot-hybrid/overview/)
  is a cybernetic lifeform, a plant in direct dialogue with a machine. Using its own internal
  electrical signals, the plant is interfaced with a robotic extension that drives it toward light.
- [Plantoid](https://hackaday.io/project/134172-plantoid), an hybrid with actuators and electrical
  potential sensing for plant control.
- [the Plant SpykerBox](https://backyardbrains.com/products/plantspikerbox), a device that records and visualizes the signals emitted by plants offering users the unique opportunity to peer into the fascinating world of plant signaling and plant behaviors.
- [Cultivating Frequencies](https://colinhonigman.com/Cultivating-Frequencies) transforms a garden into an interactive and generative musical installation by analyzing data from the garden and translating them into musical components.
- [The PhytoSense façade system](http://www.iaacblog.com/programs/phytosense/) is an interactive green facade that uses swept frequency capacitive sensing to play with light depending on touch.
- [Plant Wave](https://www.plantwave.com/): Tune into nature and listen to the music of plants.
- [SCÍON](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/scion/) is a biofeedback sensor built into a quad random voltage generator.
- [Pulsum Plantae](http://lessnullvoid.cc/content/2011/10/pulsum-plantae/) ([Github project](https://github.com/Lessnullvoid/Pulsum-Plantae)) is a project focused on bioelectrical activity readings from different types of plants.
- [Botanicus Interacticus](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/project/botanicus-interacticus) allows for rich and expressive interaction with plants.

## Technique

- [FYI on DIYs in PHL: Data Garden](http://philadelphia.thedelimagazine.com/9336/fyi-on-diys-phl-data-garden): "The sensors are “psycho galvanometers” which graph changes in galvanic response (electrical “skin” conductance/resistance) by producing a square wave of variable frequency and pulse width. Built from a [555 timer IC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC) and a handful of electronic components, each sensor is attached to a leaf on a particular plant using an electrode of silver wire and conductive gel."
- [The Lessons To Be Learned From Forcing Plants To Play Music](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/807821340/the-lessons-to-be-learned-from-forcing-plants-to-play-music?t=1590083678926): The consumer version of the invention includes sensors that issue small signals through the plant, measuring variations in electrical resistance between two points within it. "The variation in the connection is largely related to how much water is between those two points, which changes a lot as the plant is moving water around while it's photosynthesizing, then we graphed that change as a wave, and then we translate that wave into pitch, so then essentially we're getting a stream of all these pitch messages coming from the plant."
