title: Incubator v0.1
---

Together with my partner [Maud Bausier](https://maudb.gitlab.io/dok/), we are making an incubator.

As vegans, tempeh (fermeted food in general) is an important part of our diet. It is full of proteins, macrobiotics and it is delicious.

We started producing our own tempeh when we lived in Amsterdam, where we had a small room dedicated to a boiler, ensuring a constant temperature all year round. But that changed when we moved to Barcelona, where the temperature in the flat is practically the same as the outside temperature, because the windows are almost always open, which involves temperature variations that prevent us from producing the tempeh we love.

That's why we are making an incubator, called *Tempeh Machine*, to help us ferment our delicious food ourselves in all seasons. Our incubator will be entirely made in a Fab Lab, all sources will be available.
