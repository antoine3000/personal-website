In 2020, I started writing the software that would allow me to publish my personal website online. I've called it Dok, and it's my customised static site generation tool, which meets all my needs perfectly.

See my first note at [[project-management-my-documentation-tool]].

Let me quote myself:
> My ideal documentation tool is as light as possible and requires very little energy to operate; is perfectly understandable and does the tasks I want it to do - nothing more; evolves with my needs; has no Javascript, no cookies, no trackers.

And this is how Dok emerged, a project documentation system, written in Python, which enables a complex structure organised in folders and sub-folders to be represented in a website that is easily accessible to everyone. What you are currently looking at is generated by Dok itself.
