# Introduction

*The Green Observatory*, my Fab Academy final project, is a device that listens to the electrical activity of plants and represents it with a physical and meditative movement that we, humans, can observe and contemplate.

I designed, fabricated, programmed and documented this project in Barcelona in 2020. I used open-source software only and so are all my design and fabrication files.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the precious help of my Fab Academy instructors, Oscar Gonzalez, Eduardo Chamorro Martin and Josep Mart√≠, muchas gracias!
