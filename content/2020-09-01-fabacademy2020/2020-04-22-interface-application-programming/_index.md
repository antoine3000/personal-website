title: Interface application programming
open: True
---

This week is devoted to programming interfaces and applications, a subject that I really like. I would not say that I am a good programmer, I have little experience. But it's something I love to do: solve logic problems, create software that produces the result I want (or the result I didn't expect, because I also find unexpected things beautiful).

I'm going to use [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) to create an interactive audio and visual piece, a kind of experimental musical instrument that reacts to its environment.
