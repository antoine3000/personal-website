Together with Constant Mathieu, we had run a small but good webdesign studio called [Variable](http://variable.club/), from 2014 to 2019. We had put emphasis on creating our own custom tools to stay task-specific, light and versatile.

During our journey, we had the chance to work for/with a music festival (Schiev), a web radio (The Word Radio), a contemporary art museum (MIMA), a centre for contemporary art and an independent cinema (Netwerk Aalst), few architecture offices (Office KGDVS, V+, A Practice), an art school (La Cambre), and many more.
