Bonjour, my name is Antoine Jaunard (1990), I'm a designer from Brussels, Belgium, and now based in Barcelona, Spain.

I consider myself a creative technologist with a particular interest in the intersection between the physical and the digital. I have extensive experience in graphic design and web development, as well as a good knowledge of digital fabrication techniques and product design. In addition, microorganisms such as bacteria and mycelium fascinate and inspire me, inviting me to develop special tools for their cultivation.

# About me

## Domingo Club (2021-)

In march 2021, together with Maud Bausier, we founded [Domingo Club](https://domingoclub.com/), an on/offline space where we design a plant-based and transparent future food system. Our current focus is on our open-source fermenter, a device that promotes plant-based proteins and open-source tools so that anyone can make them at home. We dedicate practice to the benefit of our health, our communities and our planet.

### We have a strong interest in

- digital and decentralised fabrication
- microorganisms, mycelial network and bio-materials
- plant-based food and fermentation technology
- education, open-source and knowledge sharing


### Our fields of expertise are

- prototype design and development
- environmental sensing and physical computing
- digital fabrication
- teaching and community building


## Fab Academy (2020)

I'm an alumnus of the design and digital fabrication post-graduate program [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/). I attended the program in [Fab Lab Barcelona](https://fablabbcn.org/).

Fab Academy is a Digital Fabrication programme directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything. Fab Academy focuses on personal fabrication – prototyping your ideas into products.

This intensive program is about designing and prototyping projects using digital fabrication tools and machine, such as: computer-controlled cutting, electronics, 3D scanning and printing, electronics design,computer-controlled machining, embedded programming, molding and casting, networking and communications, mechanical design, interface and application programming and machine design.

## Variable (2014-2019)

Together with Constant Mathieu, we had run a small but good webdesign studio called [Variable](http://variable.club/), from 2014 to 2019. We had put emphasis on creating our own custom tools to stay task-specific, light and versatile.

During our journey, we had the chance to work for/with a music festival (Schiev), a web radio (The Word Radio), a contemporary art museum (MIMA), a centre for contemporary art and an independent cinema (Netwerk Aalst), few architecture offices (Office KGDVS, V+, A Practice), an art school (La Cambre), and many more.

## École de Recherche Graphique (2010-2014)

I'm graduated in Art and Graphic Design at the [École de Recherche Graphique](http://erg.be) (ERG) of Brussels.
It was all about learning how to learn, hacking systems, building things without any budget, finding the right tone to communicate with others.

# About this website

This website is my digital studio, a place where I can experiment without constraints.

It's also my personal assistant, it helps me when I doubt on how to do something I have done before. It invites me to write (and then find) my personal knowledge online.
A tool for documenting the things I learn.

This website is built with a custom static site generator that I wrote in Python. It's open-source by default, as all the things I (try to) do. Sources are available on [Github](https://github.com/antoine3000/personal-website).
