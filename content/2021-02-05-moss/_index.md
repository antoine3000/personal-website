title: Purify indoor air with moss

I am investigating what could be a low-maintenance, low-tech solution to purify indoor air, and my research has naturally led me to moss and its purifying properties.

## Starting point

One project in particular caught my attention, found on [The Earth Issue](https://www.theearthissue.com/fashion-lifestyle/foliair), it is called [Foliair](https://www.foliair.com/) and it is a decorative frame that you can hang on your wall, but it is made of moss, so it purifies your place.

## Learning by doing

As soon as I read this, I went to the nearest park to my apartment, Montju√Øc Barcelona, and picked up moss where I could find it, in order to start my own culture. This video, [How to propagate your own moss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CleZGsQGIOI) helped me to get the basics right.

## Exploration

I'm not sure yet what I am going to do with this project, but this page will be used to document my explorations.
