title: My computer
---

Few months ago, I decided to switch from the closed Apple ecosystem to the wonderful and open world of Linux. I'm running [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), a distribution based on Ubuntu, on a mid-2014 macbook pro. This machine isn't the more convenient to run a Linux distribution but I will keep using it as long as I can, even if I have some tiny hardware issues, simply because the more sustainable computer is the one I already have.

- Text editor: [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) + [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
- Terminal: [Terminator](https://github.com/software-jessies-org/jessies/wiki/Terminator)
- version control system: [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
- Static site generator: my own "spaghetti script" that I wrote in Python
- Browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

TODO: Update the content, since I now use Manjaro Linux.
