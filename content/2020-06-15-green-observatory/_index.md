# Introduction

*The Green Observatory*, my Fab Academy final project, is a device that listens to the electrical activity of plants and represents it with a physical and meditative movement that we, humans, can observe and contemplate.

I designed, fabricated, programmed and documented this project in Barcelona in 2020. I used open-source software only and so are all my design and fabrication files.

# Thanks

This project wouldn't have been possible without the precious help of my Fab Academy instructors, Oscar Gonzalez, Eduardo Chamorro Martin and Josep Martí, muchas gracias!
